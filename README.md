## LinkedIn Profile Search Mass scraper - Company x Title focus

Our powerful tool helps you search all LinkedIn Profiles and filter by companies, job titles, locations and more without compromising security or violating platform policies.

Unlike other Actors scraping anonymous "LinkedIn member"s from search, this Actor can find and scrape nearly everyone on LinkedIn.

## How It Works

1. Choose Profile Scraper Mode

- Short. The Actor will be scraping only search pages and will output only basic profile data. One search page is up to 25 results (short profiles).
- Full. Additionally to scraping search pages, it will open profile links for each of the short profiles found on search page, and scrape all profile details as well.
- Full + email search. Additionally to Full profiles, it will try to find email addresses for the profiles. **See details below**.

2. Provide any combination of the following search parameters to find LinkedIn profiles:

- General search query (fuzzy search). (e.g., `Founder`, `Marketing Manager`, `John Doe`). [The query supports operators](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a524335)
- List of current Job titles (exact search) (e.g., `Marketing Manager`, `Data Scientist`)
- List of past Job titles (exact search) (e.g., `Marketing Manager`, `Data Scientist`)
- List of locations where they currently live (e.g., `New York`, `San Francisco`, `London`). Please note that LinkedIn does not always understand your text queries. For example for "UK" query it will apply "Ukraine" location, so you should use "United Kingdom" in this case. Try this out first in the location filter input of LinkedIn search at `https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?geoUrn=%5B%22103644278%22%5D` - we will use the first suggestion from the autocomplete popup when you type your location.
- List of LinkedIn Company URLs where they currently work (e.g., `google`, `meta`, `amazon`)
- List of LinkedIn Company URLs where they previously worked (e.g., `google`, `meta`, `amazon`)
- List of LinkedIn School URLs where they studied (e.g., `stanford-university`, `MIT`)
- List of LinkedIn industry IDs (only numbers). You can find the full list of LinkedIn industry IDs in the [LinkedIn Industries](https://github.com/HarvestAPI/linkedin-industry-codes-v2/blob/main/linkedin_industry_code_v2_all_eng_with_header.csv). For example, `4` is "Software Development", `43` is "Financial Services", etc.
- List of total years of experience.
- List of years at the current company.

Other params (optionally):

- `startPage` - The page number to start scraping from. Default is 1.
- `takePages` - The number of pages to scrape. One page is up to 25 results. Maximum is 100 pages (LinkedIn limitation).
- `maxItems` - Maximum number of profiles to scrape for all queries. If you set to 0, it will scrape all available items or up to 2500 items per search query. LinkedIn doesn't allow to extract more than 2500 per one query.

Note: If you need to search by a person's full name, we recommend use our [Profile Search by name](https://apify.com/harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search-by-name) Actor instead, as it is more suitable for that use case. It's much cheaper and doesn't apply rate limits.

#### Email search

By selecting the "Full + email search" mode, you can enable our tool to perform email search for LinkedIn profiles, which is ideal for lead generation, recruitment, and networking. We perform comprehensive validation checks, including SMTP checks, to ensure the email addresses are valid and deliverable. Adaptive cost: if a LinkedIn profile is not complete enough to perform the email search - we will not charge you for the search.  
Important Note: The scraper cannot extract emails directly from a LinkedIn profile as this information is not publicly available on the platform. The email search is performed independently and **it is not guaranteed to find an email for every profile.**

3. Run the Actor

The Actor will print in the how many profiles in total were found for your query. If the total is more than 2500, you won't be able to extract all results. Consider splitting your query into multiple queries applying more filters. For example do multiple runs for locations of specific cities, instead of one run targeting entire country or region.

If you scraped a query partially and want to continue later, you can start a new run from the last scraped search page. Check the Actor's logs and find the last line like this: `Scraped search page 10. Found 25 profiles on the page.`. Start a new run with specifying the next `startPage` in the input:

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "Machine Learning Engineer",
  "profileScraperMode": "Full",
  "startPage": 11
}
```

  "about": "I find myself at a unique crossroads where science meets compassion. With over eight years of experience in pharmacology, my journey has been fueled by a genuine desire to improve patient lives. Working at CVS Health has allowed me to interact with over 100 patients each week, guiding them through their health journeys not just by dispensing medications but by truly listening and building trust. It's incredibly rewarding to know I play a part in their well-being.\n\nIn my time as a Staff Pharmacist, I’ve exceeded daily production targets by 15% while ensuring timely service for more than 1,000 patients weekly. Collaborating with diverse pharmacy teams across Los Angeles has taught me the importance of understanding unique demographic needs. Whether it’s addressing medication safety or enhancing patient satisfaction through targeted counseling initiatives, I’m dedicated to creating solutions that resonate.\n\nOne of my proudest moments was during my internship at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center when I administered over 1,500 immunizations. This experience opened my eyes to the impact preventive healthcare can have on communities. By conducting health screenings and engaging patients directly about disease management education, I contributed to improved public health outcomes—something that drives me every day.\n\nOutside of my professional life, I have a passion for photography. This hobby allows me to express my creativity while honing my attention to detail—skills that translate seamlessly into my work. Capturing moments behind the lens reminds me how important it is to appreciate the little things in life.\n\nIf you're interested in discussing innovative approaches in product development or project management within the healthcare field—or if you simply want to chat about photography—I would love to connect! Feel free to reach out via email—let’s explore how we can make an impact together.\n\nSkills:\n- Patient Care Management\n- Medication Optimization\n- Process Validation\n- Project Management\n- Drug Utilization Review",

## Linkedin Profile Search API

The actor stores results in a dataset. You can export data in various formats such as CSV, JSON, XLS, etc. You can scrape and access data on demand using API.

## Large scale scraping and Rate Limits

If you need to scrape large volumes (50,000+ profiles), the actor might possibly hit rate LinkedIn's rate limits.
We recommend to have an automation to distribute your workload evenly, so that each hour in a day has nearly the same number of requests (avoiding bursts).  
We count and reset rate limits hourly, so when it hits rate limits, you can continue scraping at the beginning of the next hour. If it still doesn't fit your volumes, please create an issue and let us know how many search pages you need to scrape per hour, and we will scale it for you.

Example of working around rate limits:

```js
const client = new ApifyClient({ token: process.env.APIFY_API_KEY });
const result1 = await client.actor('harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search').call({
  currentJobTitles: ['CEO'],
  startPage: 1,
  takePages: 10, // for example, you want to scrape 10 pages
});

const { items } = await client.dataset(result1.defaultDatasetId).listItems();

if (result1.statusMessage === 'rate limited') {
  // we've hit the rate limit.

  // await until the next hour
  await new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(
      resolve,
      3600000 -
        (new Date().getMinutes() * 60000 +
          new Date().getSeconds() * 1000 +
          new Date().getMilliseconds()),
    ),
  );

  // continue scraping the next page after the last successfully scraped page
  const lastScrapedPageNumber = items[items.length - 1]?._meta?.pagination?.pageNumber || 0;

  const result2 = await client.actor('harvestapi/linkedin-profile-search').call({
    currentJobTitles: ['CEO'],
    startPage: lastScrapedPageNumber + 1,
    takePages: 10 - lastScrapedPageNumber,
  });
}
```
